# Survivor Options Trading Strategy Configuration
# =============================================
#
# This configuration file defines parameters for the Survivor Strategy, which implements
# a systematic approach to options trading based on NIFTY index price movements.
#
# STRATEGY OVERVIEW:
# ==================
# The strategy monitors NIFTY price movements and sells options when the index moves
# beyond certain thresholds:
# - PE (Put) Trading: Triggered when NIFTY moves UP beyond pe_gap threshold
# - CE (Call) Trading: Triggered when NIFTY moves DOWN beyond ce_gap threshold
#
# Each trade uses a multiplier system based on the magnitude of price movement,
# allowing the strategy to scale positions according to market volatility.
# If working with Fyers, the values will be different and would need to adhere
# to the expected values of Fyers API (it would also require some changes in 
# the way broker methods are called in the `survivor.py` file)

default:
  # ========================================================================
  # CORE TRADING PARAMETERS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Underlying index symbol for price tracking and trade triggers
  # This is the reference index whose price movements determine when to trade
  index_symbol: "NSE:NIFTY 50"
  
  # Option series identifier - must match current trading option series
  # Format: NIFTY + expiry date (e.g., NIFTY25807 for 25th Jan 2025, 07th strike series)
  # This identifies which specific option expiry series to trade
  symbol_initials: "NIFTY25807"
  
  # ========================================================================
  # GAP PARAMETERS - TRADE TRIGGERING THRESHOLDS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Price movement threshold to trigger PE (Put) option sells
  # When NIFTY rises by this many points above the PE reference value, 
  # the strategy will sell PE options
  # Example: If pe_gap=20 and NIFTY moves up 25 points, PE trade is triggered
  pe_gap: 20
  
  # Price movement threshold to trigger CE (Call) option sells  
  # When NIFTY falls by this many points below the CE reference value,
  # the strategy will sell CE options
  # Example: If ce_gap=20 and NIFTY moves down 25 points, CE trade is triggered
  ce_gap: 20
  
  # ========================================================================
  # POSITION SIZING PARAMETERS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Base quantity for PE option trades - Multiple of Lot Size
  # Total quantity = pe_quantity × sell_multiplier
  # Example: If pe_quantity=75 and multiplier=2, total PE quantity = 150
  pe_quantity: 75
  
  # Base quantity for CE option trades - Multiple of Lot Size
  # Total quantity = ce_quantity × sell_multiplier  
  # Example: If ce_quantity=75 and multiplier=2, total CE quantity = 150
  ce_quantity: 75
  
  # ========================================================================
  # STRIKE SELECTION PARAMETERS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Distance below current NIFTY price for PE strike selection
  # PE strikes are selected this many points below the current spot price
  # Example: If NIFTY=24500 and pe_symbol_gap=200, PE strikes around 24300 are selected
  pe_symbol_gap: 200
  
  # Distance above current NIFTY price for CE strike selection
  # CE strikes are selected this many points above the current spot price
  # Example: If NIFTY=24500 and ce_symbol_gap=200, CE strikes around 24700 are selected
  ce_symbol_gap: 200
  
  # ========================================================================
  # RISK MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Minimum option premium threshold for trade execution
  # Options with premium below this value will be skipped to avoid illiquid trades
  # Prevents trading very cheap options that may have poor liquidity
  min_price_to_sell: 15
  
  # Maximum allowed position multiplier for risk control
  # Prevents excessive position sizes during large market moves
  # Example: If threshold=5 and calculated multiplier=6, trade will be blocked
  sell_multiplier_threshold: 5
  
  # ========================================================================
  # REFERENCE RESET PARAMETERS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Favorable movement threshold to reset PE reference value
  # When NIFTY moves down by this amount after PE trades, the PE reference
  # is reset closer to current price to maintain strategy responsiveness
  # Example: If pe_reset_gap=30 and NIFTY drops 35 points after PE trade, reset occurs
  pe_reset_gap: 30
  
  # Favorable movement threshold to reset CE reference value
  # When NIFTY moves up by this amount after CE trades, the CE reference
  # is reset closer to current price to maintain strategy responsiveness
  # Example: If ce_reset_gap=30 and NIFTY rises 35 points after CE trade, reset occurs
  ce_reset_gap: 30
  
  # ========================================================================
  # STARTING REFERENCE POINTS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Initial PE reference value (0 = use current market price)
  # If 0: Uses current NIFTY price as starting reference
  # If specified: Uses that value as starting reference for PE tracking
  # Example: pe_start_point=24500 starts PE tracking from 24500
  pe_start_point: 0
  
  # Initial CE reference value (0 = use current market price)
  # If 0: Uses current NIFTY price as starting reference  
  # If specified: Uses that value as starting reference for CE tracking
  # Example: ce_start_point=24500 starts CE tracking from 24500
  ce_start_point: 0
  
  # ========================================================================
  # ORDER EXECUTION PARAMETERS
  # ========================================================================
  
  # Transaction type for all orders (typically SELL for premium collection)
  # SELL: Sell options to collect premium (strategy default)
  # BUY: Buy options (not typically used in this strategy)
  trans_type: "SELL"
  
  # Exchange for trading options (NFO = National Stock Exchange Futures & Options)
  exchange: "NFO"
  
  # Order type for execution (MARKET = immediate execution at best available price)
  # MARKET: Immediate execution, no price guarantee
  # LIMIT: Execution only at specified price or better
  order_type: "MARKET"
  
  # Product type for margin and position management
  # NRML: Normal margin
  # MIS: Margin Intraday Square-off
  product_type: "NRML"
